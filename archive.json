          "body": "I mostly fixed all the errors of the module and now it is almost aligned with current version of layer0-types, layer0-types-ext and ietf-te-topology. Here is a summary:\r\n\r\n-  Whenever a grouping of layer0-types was not found, we look for it in the current version. Most of them were just renamed so it was only a matter of finding the right one.\r\n- Some of the old groupings are no longer in the layer0-types. FEC was in layer0-types-ext but term-type, wavelength assignment and flexi-grid-path-bandwidth were eliminated without clear equivalents. \r\n- Some TE-topology paths were also wrong. In most cases, it was easy to update them but, in some cases, I didn't find an equivalent node in the current TE-topo doc. In these cases, I comment out those sections.\r\n- In layer-0-types, there is an error causing validation problems. In line 523, I think `must '. >= min-slot-width-factor'` should be `must '. >= ../min-slot-width-factor'`. If someone checks that I am right, we can report this to the authors.\r\n\r\n Any help or comment is welcome with the last three points! :)",

      "body": "I mostly fixed all the errors of the module and now it is almost aligned with current version of layer0-types, layer0-types-ext and ietf-te-topology. Here is a summary:\r\n\r\n-  Whenever a grouping of layer0-types was not found, we look for it in the current version. Most of them were just renamed so it was only a matter of finding the right one.\r\n- Some of the old groupings are no longer in the layer0-types. FEC was in layer0-types-ext but term-type, wavelength assignment and flexi-grid-path-bandwidth were eliminated without clear equivalents. \r\n- Some TE-topology paths were also wrong. In most cases, it was easy to update them but, in some cases, I didn't find an equivalent node in the current TE-topo doc. In these cases, I comment out those sections.\r\n- In layer-0-types, there is an error causing validation problems. In line 523, I think `must '. >= min-slot-width-factor'` should be `must '. >= ../min-slot-width-factor'`. If someone checks that I am right, we can report this to the authors.\r\n\r\n Any help or comment is welcome with the last three points! :)\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @dperdices in https://github.com/ietf-ccamp-wg/draft-ietf-ccamp-flexigrid-media-channel-yang/issues/1#issuecomment-772474262_",

Agreed that it is a system design / planning issue and does not associate to a particular tunnel, therefore no need to define it in the model\r\n- No change to the YANG model is needed\r\n\r\n> It was suggested to reuse the transmitter tuning range definitions in l0-types as opposed to re-defining the tx-tuning-range in the tunnel model\r\n- Current l0-types-ext does not have a separate grouping definition for the tuning range. Also the existing tuning range definitions has all the parameters in read-only mode. Need to update l0-types grouping with the following changes:\r\n  - define a new grouping, \"transmitter-tuning-range\" and remove the read-only statement.\r\n  - add config=false to the container organizational-mode to make sure these parameters remain as read only in other YANG models such as ccamp-optical-impairment that use the same grouping\r\n  - use this grouping as read-write mode in the wdm-tunnel model\r\n~~~~\r\n    +--rw wdm-constraint\r\n       +--rw transceiver-constraint\r\n       |  +--rw operational-modes*     string\r\n       |  +--rw tx-tune-constraints\r\n       |     +--rw min-central-frequency?    frequency-thz\r\n       |     +--rw max-central-frequency?    frequency-thz\r\n       |     +--rw transceiver-tunability?   frequency-ghz\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n> Esther suggested to add two additional parameters, estimated GSNR at end of life, and estimated lowest (worst-case) GSNR for the computed path, in addition to the estimated current GSNR\r\n- Added the two attributes to the YANG model\r\n~~~~\r\n  augment /te:te/te:tunnels/te:tunnel/te:primary-paths\r\n            /te:primary-path/te:computed-paths-properties\r\n            /te:computed-path-properties/te:path-properties:\r\n    +--ro estimated-gsnr?          snr\r\n    +--ro estimated-eol-gsnr?      snr\r\n    +--ro estimated-lowest-gsnr?   snr\r\n~~~~\r\n",

All that would simplify the reading of the model making more easy to understand also what could be missed in the model. Other example is the \u201clist of links (and I would say nodes)  that defines the path, not clear where is in the model at a first glance, a pointer to model entity would be great.\r\n\r\n- Section 4: \u201cNote that every element in the flexi-grid topology has a reference, and this is the way in which they are called in the tunnel.\u201d . This sentence is not clear to me, do you mean an identifier, leafref ?\r\nAn example would be good here.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, for each link in the path x, we indicate which channel we are going to use, providing information about the slots, and what nodes are connected.\u201d \r\nAlso here we should add the pointer to the model to clarify where in the model that will happen.\r\n\r\nIn general, since the long list of augmentation to te-model is not easy to follow, having a short description of the major constructs of the model would make any review of the model faster and more sure. \r\n\r\n",
